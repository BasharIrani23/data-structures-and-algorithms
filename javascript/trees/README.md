Binary Tree
This project provides a JavaScript implementation of a binary tree data structure. It includes classes for creating a binary tree, performing depth-first traversals (pre-order, in-order, and post-order), as well as a binary search tree with additional methods for adding nodes and checking if a value exists in the tree.
